# Becoming Pythonic

Hi there!

In Python, there are codes which are informally divided into two categories based on the coding style:
- **Beginner** codes, the mark of someone starting in python
- **Pythonic** codes, the mark of someone with either intermediate or advanced knowledge in python programming (developers and more experienced learners)
This is a repository of codes to various challenges and problems that are "Pythonic".
